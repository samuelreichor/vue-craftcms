> [!WARNING]
> This package is no longer actively maintained. Please use the new **[`@query-api/vue`](https://github.com/samuelreichor/query-api/tree/main/packages/vue)** instead. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement.

## Why the Change?

Hi there! If you've found this package, thanks so much for checking it out. I've recently re-evaluated my code architecture and decided to adopt a monorepo approach for all the JavaScript SDKs. This change allows for better maintainability and collaboration across related projects.

The package you're likely looking for is the new **[`@query-api/vue`](https://github.com/samuelreichor/query-api/tree/main/packages/vue)**. It's designed to seamlessly replace `vue-craftcms`.

-----

## Migration Guide

Migrating to the new package is straightforward:

1.  **Update Imports:** Replace all instances of `vue-craftcms` in your import statements with `@query-api/vue`.
    ```typescript
    // Before
    import { someFeature } from 'vue-craftcms';
    // After
    import { someFeature } from '@query-api/vue';
    ```

## Need Help?

I apologize for any inconvenience this transition may cause. If you encounter any issues during the migration or have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out\!

Happy coding!
